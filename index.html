          <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
          <p>
            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
            the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
            into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
            conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
            “without pictures or conversations?”
          </p>
          <p>
            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
            the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
            pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
            getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
            with pink eyes ran close by her.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
            so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
            dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over
            afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
            this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
            Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked
            at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
            flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with
            either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning
            with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
            was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
            hedge.

          <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
          <p>
            I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
            distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years
            counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
            situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who
            knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
            business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
            affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
            marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became
            a husband and the father of a family.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I
            cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends
            was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
            mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of
            a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
            distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,
            therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
            daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
            wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship
            and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his
            friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united
            them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope
            of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
            assistance.
